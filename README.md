## About SV.CO  
  
Startup Village Collective (SV.CO) is a mission based organisation to build the collective network for teaching and learning.  
We are currently piloting with select industry partners (Facebook and Freshworks) to create a connected learning platform for faculty and students in partner Universities to teach and learn emerging technologies.

## SV.CO's Origins  
  
We trace back our origins to the pioneering work that was done to create the public-private partnership model incubator “Startup Village” that won numerous awards and helped create the model for a startup ecosystem in the state of Kerala, India.
